# Stop Slouching
**A simple but effective chrome extension that reminds you to: Stop Slouching**

Currently working on:
- Populating and creating the extension popup so that it can take an input and create periodic alarms
- Using https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/alarms/

Version_0:
- Created a basic chrome extension: manifest.json
- It has an icon for it
- It has a simple popup that has nothing (except sample text)
- It has a background.js file that has no actions except console log code
